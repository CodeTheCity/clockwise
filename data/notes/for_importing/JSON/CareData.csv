Their work is supported by the educational psychology service therapists school doctors dental officers careers advisors and visiting specialist teachers.Residential SchoolsWherever possible pupils are supported in their local school. In a very small number of cases Aberdeenshire Council makes use of some independent residential schools to educate children and young people with a wide range of additional support needs. All out-of-Authority placements have to be agreed by the Out of Authority Placement Group made up of Education and Social Work Managers.If a decision is made to place a child in the residential school then the Authority accept full responsibility for:finding a place subject to parental consultationallowing parents and child to visit the school at the Education Authoritys expense prior to making a decisionall fees for education and boardall travel expenses of the child and certain travel and subsistence expenses of the parent (see below) - however expenses such as new clothes footwear and haircuts have to be paid for by parents just as for any child attending a local schoolPlacing requests to attend independent residential schools can by made on behalf of the child / young person to the Principal Educational Psychologist who will then gather the professional views of colleagues. These will focus on whether their current provision can meet their needs and if not the suitability of the residential school. The Out of Authority Placement Group will then make a decision on whether the placement is suitable for the child.Placing requests for day placements at independent special schools can also be made and follow the same procedures as indicated above.Â  However the final decision is made by the Principal Educational Psychologist and does not require to be sanctioned by the Out of Authority Placement Group.,Aberdeenshire,,,,,,Aberdeenshire Education has a separate advice leaflet for parents whose children are placed in a residential special school and this explains in detail how parents should claim for any travel or subsistence expenses. Parents normally claim monthly and retrospectively but exceptional arrangements may be made where this is not possible.Â For example travel warrants can be issued if three weeks notice is given. Additional claim forms can be obtained from a local area office or principal educational psychologist (quote ESP 32).,,,Categories on Grampian CareDataLearning Disabilities - Education Work and Training - Additional Support for Learning at SchoolEducation Training and Work - School Education - Additional Support for Learning at School - AberdeenshireChildren and Families - Education - Additional Support for Learning at SchoolRecords on Grampian CareDataSupport for Learners - Aberdeenshire Council,Aberdeenshire Education,ASSE,Marr|Kincardine_Mearns|Garioch|Formartine|Buchan|Banff_Buchan,,DDARG,,

There are however a small number of children in Aberdeenshire Schools whose physical disabilities produce mobility and management problems for pupil parents and school.Primary schools are usually designed as single floor buildings and in modern design small changes in floor level are avoided. Where a pupil has mobility difficulties the authority will ensure reasonable adjustments are made to ensure the pupil can access the curriculum. Where adaptions to the local school would incur unreasonable expenditure and a nearby primary school has already been adapted a place may be recommended there.Most secondary schools are usually built on more than one level and require their pupils to move from class to class several times each day. It can be extremely difficult and sometimes impossible to convert existing buildings. Some schools are more suitable for pupils with mobility difficulties. In the first instance parents should contact their Area Education Office for advice.More information about Aberdeenshire Council\'s accessibillity strategyÂ can be found here: www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/parentscarers/additional/accessibility.aspTherapy ServicesParents should note that the provision of physiotherapy speech therapy and occupational therapy is the responsibility of NHS Grampian and enquiries about the availability of these services should be addressed to the family doctor or to the General Manager NHS Grampian.,Aberdeenshire,,,,,,,,Wherever a child\'s disability causes difficulty for them to walk or travel independently to school the local authority may provide transport. If the child requires an escort on such transport because of age or other factors the local authority can also arrange this. The local authority\'s policy also allows parents to transport their own child to school. The child generally benefits from the improved liaison that results between home and school - a mileage allowance may be payable to parents.,Categories on Grampian CareDataEducation Training and Work - School Education - Additional Support for Learning at School - AberdeenshireRecords on Grampian CareDataSupport for Learners - Aberdeenshire Council,Aberdeenshire Education,ASSE,Marr|Kincardine_Mearns|Garioch|Formartine|Buchan|Banff_Buchan,,DDARG,,

An Occupancy Payment is paid to the Association for the unpurchased share in exchange for exclusive occupancy of the whole property.

The scheme is part of a range of initiatives by the Scottish Government and includes:The Open Market Shared Equity scheme aims to help people on low to moderate incomes who wish to purchase a home on the open market but cannot afford to pay the full market price for a property. The applicant pays for the majority share (normally between 60% - 80% based on their income) with grant from the Scottish Government to help fund the remainder of the price of the property. Limits are set on the prices based on the size of the property and area. After the initial purchase owners can proceed to buy the property outright after a two year period or to increase their stake. Owners cannot reduce their share.The LIFT initiative aims to help first time buyers or people who have experienced a significant change in circumstances or have specific housing needs. Priority is given to tenants of Councils and Housing Associations and waiting list applicants.FactoringThe association provides a range of factoring services which includes things such as stair cleaning and repairs to communal areas.

They must be able to understand how to activate the alarm system.The system provides a normal telephone service plus an alarm button which when pressed sends a signal to a central control point manned 24-hours a day. Staff at the control point will be able to speak to the caller and will then contact a nominated friend relative or volunteer or send for a doctor or an ambulance in a medical emergency. The system is therefore dependent on an active telephone line being maintained by the service user.All Sheltered Housing schemes in Aberdeenshire are connected to the Community Alarm Scheme which will work in conjunction with Sheltered Housing Staff to provide support to tenants.TelecareTelecare provides a range of additional alarm systems that can alertÂ users when something needsÂ their attention or alert others to help them. Telecare is designed to support and maintain a person\'s independence at home.The equipment is unobtrusive and is installed inÂ the home by trained technicians with minimal disruption. Examples of telecare alert systems are:fall detectorsmoke / fire detectorflood detectorgas detectoroccupancy detectordoor contacts which can raise an alert when the door is openedpressure mats which detect movement or lack of movement Who is eligible?If you need care to live independently at home whatever your age and if you have:increasing frailtydementiaa long term health conditionphysical disabilitysensory impairmentmental health problems or problems with substance misuseSomeone from the Scheme will assess whether an applicant is eligible. Apart from those in sheltered housing applicants need have their own personal support network willing to respond in event of an emergency.To operate the alarm scheme there has to be a telephone in the house.How to applyApply to the Social Work Office in the area in which the person requiring the service lives.Â Leaflets are available from Housing and Social Work Offices or using the following link: Aberdeenshire Council - Community Alarms and Telecare (opens in pdf)Further information can be found here: Community Alarms and Telecare,Aberdeenshire,,,,,,,Members of the public can make contact direct,,Categories on Grampian CareDataOlder people - Support At HomeCare and Support Services - Support Living at Home - Community Alarms and TelecarePhysical Disabilities - Support At HomeRecords on Grampian CareDataOccupational Therapy Service - Aberdeenshire CouncilSocial Work - Introduction to Services - Aberdeenshire Council,Link maintained by Grampian CareData,GCASC,Marr|Kincardine_Mearns|Garioch|Formartine|Buchan|Banff_Buchan,,,,

The only stipulation is that there are no hymns or prayers although many of the ceremonies include a period of quiet or a time of reflection.Further information and guidance on the following can be obtained from the Co-ordinator.NamingsAll births have to be officially registered but a ceremony to welcome a new member of the family circle can be arranged at any time. Advice and help in composing a naming ceremony is offered. Friends or relatives can be nominated as supporting adults.Sincere promises can be made by the parents and any supporting adults and the ceremony can incorporate symbolic actions such as giving of presents cutting a cake signing an album or certificate lighting a candle planting a tree or shrub or taking a handprint. Music and poetry or prose may also be used.A similar ceremony can be conducted for an older child or for two or more children together.MarriageA Humanist wedding allows people in conjunction with the Humanist Celebrant to choose the content and structure of the ceremony. Poetry prose music and symbolic gestures such as lighting candles can all be included and couples can write their own vows of commitment to each other.Wedding ceremonies can be offered for couples in various situations for example after divorce people who already have children or same sex couples.Humanist weddings have the same legal status as civil and religious weddings as long as they are conducted by an HSS Celebrant who has been authorised by the Registrar General of Scotland.Same sex couples may choose to have a Humanist Partnership ceremony though these are not legally recognised in Scotland.FuneralsHumanist Officiants can plan a personal and dignified funeral ceremony and conduct it on the day. Arrangements can be made by the next of kin or through a Funeral Director. It is advisable before arranging the time and place of the funeral to ensure that an Officiant is available.Family members or friends may if they wish take part in the ceremony which can include poems prose personal tributes and music.,Moray|Aberdeenshire|Aberdeen,,,,Humanist Society of Scotland272 Bath StreetGlasgowG2 4JRTel: 0870 874 9002,,Each Officiant decides their own level of fee for ceremonies,Members of the public can make contact direct,,Categories on Grampian CareDataLife In The Community - Faiths and Beliefs - Humanism,Humanist Society of Scotland,HSS,Marr|Kincardine_Mearns|Garioch|Formartine|Buchan|Banff_Buchan,https://www.facebook.com/HumanistSocietyScotland,,@humanistsociety,

It acts as a passport to several services making them simpler to get and some benefits are only available to people who are registered blind. You do not have to be totally blind to be registered blind. The test which the eye specialist (Consultant Ophthalmologist) applies is whether you are \so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential\"". Other disabling factors such as youth or old age are ignored for this test. Advisory visits can be made by NESS to anyone contemplating seeking registration.

If there are problems arrangements will be made to organise alternative care for the pet.,Moray|Aberdeenshire|Aberdeen,,,,,Office hours but where possible volunteers try to cover for out of hours emergencies,No charge is made for the service but owners are expected to pay for the food and in the case of cats for the litter and for any veterinary fees which might be incurred during fostering,If possible should be made through social workers doctors home helps hospital administrators and other carers who will normally arrange for the pet to be taken to the foster home,,Categories on Grampian CareDataCare and Support Services - Animal Care and Pet Therapy,Pet Fostering Service Scotland,VPFS,Marr|Kincardine_Mearns|Garioch|Formartine|Buchan|Banff_Buchan,,,,

It should be noted that although patients have complete freedom of choice of dentists dentists may exercise their right to accept or decline patients. Information has been prepared in accordance with the National Health Service (General Dental Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2010.All practitioners operate an appointment system and consult by appointment except in an emergency.Certain practitioners limit their services to the provision of orthodontic treatment and normally only provide treatment for patients who are referred from general dental practitioners. Orthodontics is a branch of dentistry which involves the straightening or moving of teeth to improve their appearance and to improve how they work.People under 18 register with a dental practitioner under what is called a capitation arrangement and those over 18 under a continuing care arrangement. This means that once a person has joined a dentists list as an NHS patient they can enjoy lifetime registration unless either patient or dental practice decides to end the registration.Patient and dentist will discuss any dental work needed and jointly agree a Treatment Plan which sets out the treatment needed. After the initial examination the dentist will discuss how much the treatment will cost and the cost of each item on the treatment plan - even for those who pay charges there is a limit to what they can be asked to pay. A patient will receive a copy of the Treatment Plan to take home with them so they have a reminder of what is to be done. If there is a change in the proposed treatment after the treatment has started the dentist will inform the patient and both can decide how best to proceed. Everything that is needed to make the mouth healthy can be provided under the NHS but some of this treatment can be provided privately if wished. The dentist will discuss with the patient the different options available and compare the costs / benefits before deciding on what suits them. A filling or crown provided under the NHS which has to be replaced within a year may be replaced free of NHS charge.In an emergency telephone advice outwith surgery hours is available and the dentist will try to arrange treatment within a reasonable time. However emergency arrangements are only applicable to registered patients.ComplaintsMany complaints arise from misunderstandings and if you have a problem or are unhappy with something that has happened it is often best to talk to someone close to the cause of your complaint such as your dentist or the practice manager who will try to sort out the problem. If you would prefer to talk to someone who is not directly involved in your care you may wish to contact the appropriate complaints officer. All dental practices operate in-house complaints procedures and have a complaints officer or someone designated to receive complaints. If the practice complaints officer is involved in your care you may wish to contact the Feedback AdviserÂ at NHS Grampian as undernoted who can act as an intermediary orÂ to assist in resolving your complaint. It is important that you make your complaint as early as possible. Normally a complaint about NHS services will only be investigated if it is made:within 6 months of the incident causing the problem ormade within 6 months of discovering the problem provided that is within 12 months of the incidentThese time limits can be waived if there is a good reason why you could not complain earlier.This initial stage in the complaints procedure is called Local Resolution. Normally a complaint will be acknowledged within 2 days of receipt by the practice and an explanation provided within 10 working days. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of Local Resolution you can refer your case to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman explaining in writing why you are dissatisfied with the Local Resolution or with how your complaint has been handled. Any request for the involvement of the OmbudsmanÂ should be made within 28 calendar days of the letter from the practice advising you of the outcome of Local Resolution.

Alternatively the Community Dental Service provides a service for adults with certain disabilities or medical conditions but patients must be referred by their doctor.Some dental practices have surgeries located on the ground floor but wheelchair users and people with mobility problems would need to check on accessibility. If a patient is not able to secure dental services from a general dental practitioner or a patient is not registered with a dentist they may qualify to be seen by the Community Dental Service. Arrangements can then be made to provide treatment on a domiciliary basis either in the patients own home or in the mobile dental unit.Further information about service can be found here: NHS Grampian Dental Services,Moray|Aberdeenshire|Aberdeen,,,,,,,,,Categories on Grampian CareDataHealth and Well-being - Dentists - Dental Information and AdviceRecords on Grampian CareDataDental Services - IntroductionGrampian Dental Out of Hours Service - NHS GrampianDental Information and Advice Line - NHS Grampian,NHS Grampian Primary Care Dental Service,XCH,Marr|Kincardine_Mearns|Garioch|Formartine|Buchan|Banff_Buchan,,,,

As part of this monitoring children are examined regularly by their doctor to ensure that development is taking place normally.Minor surgery includes services such as injections removal of cysts warts or other lesions and other minor procedures. Doctors may only provide these services if they have been accepted by NHS Grampian as having the appropriate qualifications training and experience.Health Promotion ServicesAll general practices offer advice on health improvement - often this will be part of routine appointments as health promotion is involved in the treatment of most illnesses. Some practices offer special sessions for health promotion often run by nurses. These sessions will usually be by appointment and may be aimed at certain groups of patients. They may involve health checks and general advice on good health or may be specially for patients who already have an illness and who could benefit from help such as different types of exercise or a change in diet.RegistrationEveryone has a right to be on a doctor\'s list. To register with a doctor you should go along to a surgery in the local area and ask to be registered with the practice. You may be invited to meet withÂ a doctor before they will register you. If a doctor will not accept you for registration you may contact the Practitioner Services Division (Aberdeen) and ask to be assigned to a doctor.If you need to be assigned to a doctor please write to:The Operations ManagerPractitioner Services Division Medical (Aberdeen) Bridge View1 North Esplanade WestAberdeenAB11 5QFYour address is an important factor in choosing a doctor - each practice covers a particular area and it may be that the preferred practice does not cover the area where you live. You can obtain information from Practitioner Services Division (Aberdeen) or NHS Grampian about practices which provide services in your area.Once registered you will receive a medical card from the Practitioner Services Division (Aberdeen) which should be kept in a safe place for reference. If you are an adult you will normally be offered a health check within 28 days of joining a doctor\'s list.If you change your address and want to transfer to another doctor you can do so. You can also change your doctor for any other reason - you do not have to say what your reason is and you do not need to tell your doctor that you intend to change. If you do wish to change you should go to the practice you have chosen and ask to register. You will be asked for your medical card and if you do not have it you will have to fill in a form for registration purpose.Temporary ResidentsIf you are staying temporarily in an area and you are not registered with a local doctor you may apply to any doctor to be accepted for treatment. You will qualify for treatment as a temporary resident if you are staying in the area for more than 24-hours but less than three months. If you are registered as a temporary resident while away from home you are entitled to the same services you would receive if you were a permanent resident in that area - registration with your doctor at home is not affected.If you are staying in an area for less than 24 hours and you need emergency medical treatment you may go to any doctor for treatment.Appointments / ServicesMost doctors in the North East of Scotland have an appointment system and you can make an appointment by phone or by calling at the surgery. Usually you can choose to make an appointment with any doctor within the practice.In certain circumstances you may want a home visit from your doctor. The doctor is responsible for deciding whether or not a home visit is necessary so it is important to make sure that you give the doctor or the receptionist as much information as you can about the problem.If they think it is necessary a doctor can refer you to hospital or other specialist services for tests or treatment.How you can helpIf you have an appointment please arrive on time if you are late this can cause delays for other patients who are due to be seen after you. It is also important to let the practice know if you cannot attend as your appointment can be re-allocated to someone else who may need to see the doctor urgently.Normally you will be expected to visit the surgery to consult your doctor and requests for home visits should only be made when you are too ill to get to the surgery.Out of hours services are for emergencies only and should not be used for routine care which can be dealt with during normal working hours. Out of hours services are provided by Grampian Medical Emergency Division (GMED). When telephoning for a visit out of hours you may be asked to attend a Primary Care Centre rather than be seen at home. This covers all Grampian practices except Braemar Clinic who undertake their own out of hours services.Trainees / StudentsSome practices may have a General Practitioner Registrar working for them. A registrar is a qualified medical practitioner who is fully registered with the General Medical Council and is spending some time doing post graduate training in a general practice setting. Registrars will carry out consultations and they may also be involved in special procedures including minor surgery if they have approval from NHS Grampian to do so.Practices may also have other students working there form time to time such as student nurses and undergraduate medical students. You will be given a full explanation if your doctor or nurse would like a student to be present when they see you and on each occasion you will be able to refuse if you wish to do so.ComplaintsMany complaints arise from misunderstandings and if you have a problem or if you are unhappy with something that has happened it is often best to talk to someone close to the cause of your complaint such as your doctor or the practice manager who will try to sort it out.If you would prefer to talk to someone who is not directly involved in your care you may wish to contact the appropriate complaints officer. All GP practices operate in house complaints procedures and have a complaints officer or someone designated to receive complaints.Alternatively you may wish to contact the Complaints Manager at NHS Grampian as undernoted who can act as an intermediary and can facilitate the complaints procedure. NHS Grampian can also arrange for a lay conciliator to assist in resolving your complaint.It is important that you make your complaint as early as possible. Normally a complaint about NHS services will only be investigated if it is made:within 6 months of the incident causing the problem ormade within 6 months of discovering the problem provided that is within 12 months of the incidentThese time limits can be waived if there is a good reason why you could not complain earlier.The initial stage in the complaints procedure is called Local Resolution. Normally a complaint will be acknowledged within 3 days of receipt by the practice and an explanation provided within 10 working days. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of Local Resolution you can request an Independent Review by contacting the Office of the Independent Lay Convenor explaining in writing why you are dissatisfied with Local Resolution or how your complaint has been handled.Office of the Independent Lay ConvenorSummerfield House2 Eday RoadAberdeenAB15 6REAny request for Independent Review should be made within 28 calendar days of the letter from the practice advising you of the outcome of Local Resolution.If you would like more information or advice on the complaints procedure please contact:NHS GrampianÂ Feedback TeamSummerfield HouseÂ 2 Eday RoadÂ Â AberdeenAB15 6RETel: 0845Â 337 6338Email: nhsgrampian.feedback@nhs.netFurther information can be found here: NHS Grampian - Feedback and ComplaintsNHS services are provided by NHS Grampian.Enquiries should be directed to:Primary Care Contracts TeamNHS GrampianWestholmeWoodend HospitalQueens RoadAberdeenAB15 6LSTel: 01224 556307,Moray|Aberdeenshire|Aberdeen,,,,,,,,,Categories on Grampian CareDataHealth and Well-being - DoctorsRecords on Grampian CareDataG-MED (Grampian Medical Emergency Department),NHS Grampian Primary Care Contracts Team,XPCD,,,,,

People do not have to register with an ophthalmic medical practitioner or optometrist. An ophthalmic medical practitioner or optometrist is free to accept or decline to do a sight test.Sight TestNHS eye examinations are free to all patients resident in Scotland and other UK residents visiting Scotland but overseas visitors are subject to the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2006The only people entitled to a voucher for glasses are listed below.PrescriptionIf a sight test shows that a person needs glasses the optometrist must give the patient a prescription. The prescription is a persons by right and is valid for two years. A person can take their prescription to any supplier and does not have to purchase glasses from the practitioner who did the sight test.NHS Vouchers for GlassesSome people are entitled to vouchers for glasses or contact lenses but will have to pay the difference if the cost of the glasses or contact lenses is more than the value of the vouchers.A person is entitled to receive an NHS spectacle voucher if they:are under 16in full time education and under the age of 19receiving or their partner is receiving Income Support Income based Jobseekers Allowance Working Families Tax Credit and named on a Tax Credit NHS Exemption Certificate Disabled Persons Tax Credit and named on a Tax Credit NHS Exemption Certificate Pension Credit guaranteed creditnamed on an certificate HC2 from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP)People named on an HC3 certificate might also get help towards the cost of a private sight test.For further information about Optical Vouchers see related record.People who need complex lensesIf a person is prescribed complex or powerful glasses with at least one lens which has a power in any one meridian of plus or minus 10 or more dioptres or is a prism controlled bifocal lens the optometrist will mark the prescription accordingly. In either of these cases the person will be entitled to a free NHS sight test and also a spectacle voucher towards the cost of glasses.RefundsPeople should make sure they have a decision on their claim before buying glasses. If a person pays for their glasses unless they were prescribed through the Hospital Eye Service it is not possible to get a refund afterwards even if they were entitled to a voucher.How to get GlassesGlasses do not have to be bought from the optometrist who carried out a sight test. A person can buy glasses or contact lenses from any optometrist or shop that sells them provided they are made from a registered opticians prescription and in the case of unregistered suppliers subject to certain safeguards. Unregistered suppliers are not allowed to sell glasses or contact lenses to a person under 16 years of age. The Ophthalmic List has only registered suppliers.Broken AppointmentsThe optician should be informed in good time if a person cannot keep an appointment otherwise they may have to pay for the appointment even if entitled to help with the cost of glasses or NHS sight test.Home VisitsIf a person is housebound because of illness or disability they can ask their doctor or an optician to arrange for a home sight test. People entitled to a free NHS Sight Test can also get a free home visit from an optometrist. If a person is not entitled to a free NHS Sight Test they may still be able to get help with the cost of a home visit if they hold a certificate HC3 from the Department of Works and Pensions (DWP). People who are not entitled to a free home visit or help with the cost may have to pay for the visit - more details can be obtained from an optometrist.Sight Test ComplaintsIf a person has a complaint about an NHS sight test it is advisable to talk to the ophthalmic medical practitioner or optometrist in the first instance with a view to clearing up any misunderstanding. If a person would prefer to talk to someone who is not directly involved in their care they may wish to contact the appropriate complaints officer. All practitioners operate in house complaints procedures and have a complaints officer or someone designated to receive complaints - staff should be able to advise to whom any complaints should be made. A person can also contact the Complaints Manager at NHS Grampian (undernoted) who can act as an intermediary or arrange for a lay conciliator to assist in resolving the complaint. It is important to make a complaint as early as possible. Normally a complaint about NHS services will only be investigated if it is made:within 6 months of the incident causing the problem ormade within 6 months of discovering the problem provided that is within 12 months of the incidentThese time limits can be waived if there is a good reason why you could not complain earlier.This initial stage in the complaints procedure is called Local Resolution. Normally a complaint will be acknowledged within 3 days of receipt by the practice and an explanation provided within 10 working days. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of Local Resolution you can request an Independent Review by contacting the office of the Independent Lay Convenor explaining in writing why you are dissatisfied with the Local Resolution or with how your complaint has been handled. Any request for Independent Review should be made within 28 calendar days of the letter from the practice advising you of the outcome of Local Resolution.

Such referrals are often made around the age of 3 years but younger children can be referred if necessary.

The service has developed strong working links with other agencies ensuring that parents and children can be guided and helped by the most appropriate service. The Educational Psychology Service is staffed by educational psychologists and all schools in the area have a designated psychologist who visits on a regular basis and is available to staff for assessment of pupils with additional support needs.

This enables the parents school and local authority to check that the childs needs are identified and regularly reviewed.Parents have the right to request a full assessment of their child from the age of three years with a view to establishing if there are additional support needs which require a CSP. Without the full co-operation and participation of the parents it is not possible to provide an accurate assessment - they will be consulted at all stages. Parents will also be shown the CSP in draft form so that they can express their views. Parents have the right of appeal against the content of parts of the CSP and over deciding whether or not a CSP should be opened. When a copy of the CSP is issued to them all parents are told of the action which they must take in order to make an appeal for example reference to the Additional Support Needs Tribunal.In practice educational placements for children with special educational needs are arranged locally with the full agreement of parents and with the minimum of delay. A few placements are made in independent schools or in schools outwith Moray but always with the full co-operation of parents. The continuing appropriateness of each placement and the educational progress of each pupil will be reviewed at least once per session thereafter. Parents may request that a reassessment be undertaken at any point in a school session. This will normally be agreed by the education authority if it is reasonable.For advice contact Educational Services on Tel: 01343 563632 or the Educational Psychology Service on Tel: 01343 550999.Placing RequestsAll parents have the right to make a Placing Request - that is to ask that their child should attend a particular school provided the authority does not incur additional expense. Initially all such requests are made to the Director of Educational Services. In these instances where a pupils additional support needs are such that they cannot be catered for in the local school parents will have had contact with the educational psychologist who will have suggested a particular resource.For more information about units and bases please see the related record.,Moray,field_access_opt_8|field_access_opt_6,,,,,,,,Categories on Grampian CareDataChildren and Families - Education - Additional Support for Learning at SchoolEducation Training and Work - School Education - Additional Support for Learning at School - MorayRecords on Grampian CareDataEducational Services - Moray CouncilEducational Services to Support Additional Support Needs - Moray - IntroductionEducational Psychology Service - Moray,The Moray Council Educational Services,MCE,,,,,

Such children are often termed dyslexic but since the reading difficulty is frequently associated with problems in spelling handwriting and numbers they are preferably described more generally as having specific learning difficulties.Early identification and help are all important if children with specific learning difficulties are not to suffer long term educational disability. The Council has a number of teachers who have gained additional qualifications such as the RSA Diploma in Specific Learning Difficulties. These teachers should be consulted for an initial assessment and schools are able to make referral to the Educational Psychology Service wherever there appears to be a marked discrepancy between a pupil\'s language ability or general understanding and their progress in reading writing or spelling. A psychological assessment may be necessary to determine the pattern of the child\'s abilities and disabilities and to establish the most suitable ways of accelerating progress.Further information about Additional Support for Learning can be found here: Additional Support for Learning,Moray,,,,,,,Parents who believe their children may have specific learning difficulties should in the first instance discuss the matter with their Head Teacher. Parents of pupils entering Moray at secondary age should note that pupils with a history of dyslexia may be eligible to receive support for learning and where necessary special examination arrangements may be negotiated between the school and the Scottish Examination Board.,,Categories on Grampian CareDataEducation Training and Work - School Education - Additional Support for Learning at School - MorayRecords on Grampian CareDataEducational Services - Moray CouncilEducational Services to Support Additional Support Needs - Moray - Introduction,The Moray Council Educational Services,MCE,,,,,

These services are provided within schools by teaching staff and others with additional support provided through a team of outreach staff. In addition the Inclusion and Support Service has two specialist centres in Elgin where more individual help is provided to children who have particularly challenging behaviour.Information about additional support for learning can be found here: Additional SupportThe main aim of the Inclusion and Support Service is to support children and young people of school age who experience significant social emotional and behavioural needs.Other aims are:to work alongside school staff parents social workers educational psychologists Moray Youth Action staff NCH staff and others in gathering information related to the needs of all young people referred to the lSS. The main forum for this will be the Local Integrated Assessment Planning (LIAP) meeting to provide all young people with an education and care plan that has clear objectives and measures success. The plan will promote effective joint working between teachers social workers parents/carers other partners and the young person. The plan will be drawn up in partnership with the young person and all relevant others to work with teachers parents and others in developing individualised education programmes that seek to meet a child\'s or young person\'s learning needs as well as promote self-awareness social skills and self-esteem to work with children and young people on the reasons why they are experiencing social and/or emotional and/or behavioural needs. This may be on a one-to-one or small group basis and involve families teachers and other partners to prioritise and target support so that preventative services can be delivered. The targeting will include children and young people who are experiencing transitions in their lives such as moving from one school to another moving from home into a care placement moving from school to college training or unemployment for ISS staff to liaise and consult with school staff social work staff parents/carers and others to ensure the quality of their work and to identify service development and staff training issues The Inclusion and Support Service comprises three strands of support these being an Outreach Service to schools and two Moray-wide Learning Centres located in Elgin.All young people referred to the Inclusion and Support Service are subject to an ongoing assessment of their needs. Intervention is therefore on a planned basis and is written into an individualised education and care plan designed to address specific concerns. Young people remain on the roll of their local school whilst accessing the Inclusion and Support Service.Individual education and care plans are negotiated on a time-limited basis through a joint planning process. This process includes parents/carers and the young person. Parents retain the responsibility for the education of their child and can appeal to the Head of Educational Support Services if they disagree with the Individual Education Plan being proposed.Individual Education and Care Plans outline the entitlements and responsibilities of:the young persontheir parents/carerstheir own school staffservice staffother partnersThe plan includes clear statements of strengths concerns objectives/targets and the timing of reviews.Outreach ServiceThe Outreach Service provides support by staff who work on a peripatetic basis across Moray. Outreach programmes reflect the belief that support should be provided at a local level if possible. There is a relationship between the Outreach Service and the school programmes being provided by the Social Work Department through Moray Youth Action staff.The Outreach Service provides additional teaching and teaching auxiliary expertise to class teachers and pupils that can enhance the more social programmes provided by Moray Youth Action.Learning CentresThe Learning Centres located at Beechbrae Education Centre and in Pinefield Industrial Estate Elgin provide the Inclusion and Support Service with high quality and varied accommodation for young people who have specific needs requiring time-limited off-site provision.At Beechbrae Education Centre services provided focus primarily on children of primary school ageAt Pinefield Industrial Estate services provided focus primarily on young people of secondary school age.

There are however a substantial number of children in Moray Schools whose physical disabilities do produce significant mobility and management problems for the pupil parents and school.The Education Authority\'s policy is to open a Co-ordinated Support Plan (CSP) for pupils whose physical disability gives rise to additional support or management needs which require continuing review. The use of the CSP ensures that parents are consulted at all stages in their child\'s educational career and the CSP is reviewed at appropriate intervals. This is particularly important when transfer from one school to another is being considered - for example from primary to secondary - so that parents pupils and staff can discuss and identify any special arrangements or resources which may be required. Many primary schools present few problems of access to a child in a wheelchair in callipers or using a walking aid. They are usually designed as single floor buildings and small changes in floor level are avoided in modern designs. Lifting and Handling training is available by RoSPA for staff.The child\'s curriculum is largely in the hands of the class teacher and movement about the building is not so pronounced as at secondary school. There is a considerable input from NHS Grampian physiotherapists and involvement in the MOVE programme.Given adequate notice the Education Authority will normally be able to make the minor alterations to the architecture of a child\'s local primary school in order to admit the child. Where very special problems exist such as the need for assistance with toileting or mobility the Authority will provide an appropriate auxiliary service to the school. This is under review to ensure that the authority complies with the Education (Disability Strategies and Pupils\' Educational Records) (Scotland) Act 2002.Wherever a child\'s disability makes it difficult for them to walk or travel independently to school the authority accepts responsibility for providing and paying for transport. If the child requires an escort on such transport because of age or other factors the authority will also arrange this. The Authority\'s policy also enables parents to transport their own child. The child generally benefits from the improved liaison that results between home and school and a mileage allowance is payable to parents.Where significant input is identified and where a nearby primary school has already been adapted and has auxiliary help the authority may recommend a place at the latter school especially where adaptations to the area school would entail considerable cost and duplication of facilities. The Education Authority also recognises the need to provide access and appropriate support for pupils when they transfer from primary to secondary school.

Children and young people with a diagnosed hearing loss are visited at home and at school as frequently as staffing levels permit and the clients needs dictate. These teachers advise and assist the class teacher (and in some cases other members of staff) in appropriate provision for the child.This help may be as simple as a reminder of the childs need to face the teacher on all occasions when important instructions are being delivered. It may involve more complex analysis of the language and management problems posed by the child the type of group work suitable for the child or the provision of specialised learning aids. The peripatetic teachers frequently take children / students on an individual basis supplementing the work of the class teacher making sure that the child / young person has the language and understanding necessary to deal with the work of the class.Peripatetic teachers are also very much involved with parents particularly at the pre-school stage and visit homes as often as possible. Parents often look for advice on how to help with the learning and other associated needs of their hearing impaired children. The service provides detailed advice on speech and language development the management of hearing aids and the use of speech training equipment.Provision for Children with Severe or Profound Hearing LossIn Moray many children with severe and profound hearing loss attend a mainstream school with support from the Sensory Education Service and if necessary additional learning support.

There is a recognition of the unique strengths and weaknesses of each individual. The training process adapts to each individual and their circumstances. Self defence is not part of the training.The Taoist Tai Chi Society of Great Britain is a registered charity and is established for the protection and preservation of good health within the community through the promotion and practice of all levels of taichi.The founder of the Taoist Tai Chi Society Master Moy Lin-Shin developed this form of Tai Chi which places emphasis on health and relaxation from his experience as a Taoist monk. Taoist Tai Chi recognises the importance of mental as well as physical well being and therefore incorporates involvement of the mind as well as the body.Classes are taught with a view to helping students improve their health and not merely providing them with a recreational opportunity.Many members of the Taoist Tai Chi Society join and remain with the specific intention of using Taoist Tai Chi to help them deal with health problems such as arthritis Parkinsons brain injuries multiple sclerosis stroke and heart disease.Information about local classes can be found here: Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire Moray,Moray|Aberdeenshire|Aberdeen,,,,,,,,Members help each other with transport.

The rent goes to the housing association and the mortgage contribution to the building society bank or other lender. Shared ownership housing is aimed mainly at people who cannot afford to buy a house outright on the housing market but are still keen and financially able to make a start on the home ownership ladder and invest some of their money in their property. The occupiers housing costs can vary according to the type of mortgage and the size of the ownership share for example 25% 50% or more. Shared ownership occupiers have the right to buy further 25% tranches of the equity up to and including 100% which means that they then become the sole owners of the houses.For further information contact the Housing Association owning the scheme.,Aberdeenshire,,,,,,,,,Categories on Grampian CareDataHousing and Accommodation - Council HousingHousing and Accommodation - Housing Advice and InformationHousing and Accommodation - Housing Associations and OrganisationsHousing and Accommodation - Sheltered Housing,Aberdeenshire Council Housing,ASHC,Marr|Kincardine_Mearns|Garioch|Formartine|Buchan|Banff_Buchan,,,,

A key role of the council is to support NHS Boards and monitor how they carry out their statutory duty to involve patients carers and the public in the planning and delivery of NHS services.There are 8 special Health Boards that provide services across Scotland and 14 regional Boards. The Scottish Health Councils remit covers all NHS Boards apart from NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. There are separate arrangements in place to monitor how it fulfils its Patient Focus and Public Involvement duties as the Scottish Health Council is part of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland.The Scottish Health Council has three core functions:Assessment - independently assessing the performance of NHS Boards in delivering patient-focused services and ensuring public involvement Development - supporting the development of good practice in Patient Focus and Public Involvement Feedback - ensuring that patients carers and the public are able to make their views on health services known. The Scottish Health Council is also responsible for providing secretariat and support services for Independent Scrutiny Panels. These are expert panels set up by the Scottish Government to consider proposals for major changes in local NHS services in Scotland. More information can be found on the Independent Scrutiny Panels website.The Councils Corporate Plan and annual Work Plan provide more detail about how we carry out our core functions.

Each CHP is geographically aligned with their Local Authority partner and is led by a General Manager and Clinical Lead.CHPs will provide the main vehicle for improving the integration and accessibility of services for local communities across primary and specialist (hospital) NHS care and between health and social care CHPs will link with clinical teams work in partnership with local authorities the voluntary sector and others to support the improvement of the health and wellbeing of local communities CHPs will involve the public patients and carers in decisions concerning the delivery of health and social care for their communities Each CHP is aligned to the local authority so that it is easy to work together where both health and local authority contribute to services for example in services for elderly people and for children CHPs will work with acute services for example to help manage waiting times for outpatient appointments or for surgery and to make sure that there is better co-ordination of services after discharge from hospital ,Moray|Aberdeenshire|Aberdeen,,,,,,,,,Categories on Grampian CareDataBrowse By Subject - Health and Well-being - Community Health PartnershipsÂ ,,GCNHS,Marr|Kincardine_Mearns|Garioch|Formartine|Buchan|Banff_Buchan,,,,

Free help and advice is available to anyone in need irrespective of race gender or belief through a debt counselling team. Working closely with local authorities and national finance institutions Christians Against Poverty aims to offer a sustainable solution and hope for the future.After calling the Head Office freephone number a visit from the local CAP office will be arranged.The counsellor will arrange a visit at home to gather financial information. Home visits ensure that all of the paperwork is to hand and avoids problems caused by lack of transport or child care. On the first visit the counsellor will explain how CAP helps the implications of the service and the next steps.Following a decision to work with CAP the counsellor will prioritise essential bills such as mortgage and utilities. They will then contact these companies to agree payments in order to see the person out of debt in a reasonable amount of time. A budget will be made showing incomes and outgoings and also include savings for Christmas or emergencies. The counsellor will visit at home again to talk through the budget and how to make payment.A CAP account is then set up to use to pay bills and debts. One weekly or monthly payment will be made to the CAP account which will then be distributed to creditors on the persons behalf. The CAP account simplifies a budget and is especially beneficial for those without a bank account.The Creditor Liason unit informs secondary creditors (credit cards bank loans) of the repayment offer laid out in the budget. CAPs knowledge of the legal system and relationship will creditors allows negotiation of affordable repayments stoppage of interest and charges and ensures priority debts are cleared first. This releases the person from threatening phone calls and letters.If the debts are very large and cannot be paid off in a reasonable amount of time CAPs insolvency department will explain all of the options including insolvency and bankruptcy in order for the person to choose the best way forward.After six months or so of the CAP account running smoothly the case will be transferred from our local centre to the client support unit in Bradford for ongoing support until the person is debt free.,Aberdeen,,,,,Mon-Wed: 9.30am-3.00pmThu: 9.30am-3.30pm,Free,Members of the public can make contact direct,,Categories on Grampian CareDataBrowse By Subject - Money Matters - Financial and Legal Advice - Managing DebtLife In The Community - Faiths and Beliefs - Faith-Based Support Services,Christians Against Poverty,VPAC,,https://www.facebook.com/CAPuk,,https://twitter.com/CAPuk,

Although the Club still retains affiliation to the local British Telecom Sports Club it now has a very broad membership from all walks of life and is open for anyone to join.The Club has a regular programme of fortnightly Sunday outings each year from late February/early March to early November and monthly winter walks in December January and early February. Outings are by hired coach leaving from New Telecom House South College St with a second pick-up point at Duthie Park Riverside Drive. Advance booking is necessary for these outings.The annual programme comprises a rich variety of both â€˜point-to-pointâ€™ walks and circular walks. The Club does not operate a leader / back marker system and instead issues individual route notes ideally participants should have map reading and navigational skills.Â However this is not essential as guidance will be provided for inexperienced walkers. Suitable outdoor clothing and footwear is essential. Walkers wearing denim clothing may be turned away.A change of clothes can normally be left on the coach and tea or coffee is usually provided at the conclusion of most walks.Each year the Club organises a hiking week in Scotland utilising hostel accommodation. This generally takes place in May.Check the groups website for details on booking a place on a walk.,Aberdeen,,,,,,The annual membership fees are currently Â£13 for adults Â£6 for juniors (aged under 16) and Â£5 for day members.Â ,,,Categories on Grampian CareDataLeisure and Sport - Sports and Recreation - Sporting and Fitness Activities,NHS Grampian - Physical Activities Pathway,GC,,,,,

All walks end with a session of about an hour in the pub. A number of social events are also organised including a Christmas party.The Stocket Hillwalking Club is affiliated to the Mountaineering Council of Scotland. The MCofS provides an extensive range of support to affiliated clubs and their members enjoy a range of benefits including access to huts and Civil & Employers\' Liability Insurance. Please ensure that you familiarise yourself with the conditions of the insurance cover before going on the hills with the Club.The Stockets go hill walking throughout the year generally in the Grampian Mountains and other hills within a day\'s travel of Aberdeen. Most of the walks include hills over 3000 feet in height; often these are Munros. Typically between 15 and 25 members go on each walk. By using a coach many \through\"" walks can be arranged i.e. routes starting and finishing at different places.The Club runs a monthly one-day walk usually on a Sunday. This means that we operate through the winter season unlike a few of the local clubs. The winter walks usually cover 8 to 12 miles. A number of winter walks have been altered to suit conditions but very few are canceled due to extreme weather.Summer walks tend to be longer to make use of the daylight hours available and are generally between 15 and 20 miles.An alternative route following a shorter lower level walk is generally available; by providing two walks the Club aims to cater for all members\' requirements.The Stockets organise up to three weekends a year further a field providing an opportunity to visit the West Coast and the rest of the Highlands. Weekends away are a great opportunity for beginners to fulfill their desire to experience hills further afield and for Munro baggers to add few more ticks to their list. It is also a good way to get to know fellow Club members on a more sociable basis.As in most cases weekend trips are organised by car and lifts. The more people share a car the more economical it becomes for everyone. Accommodation is usually in a hostel or bunkhouse.Details of the walks for the year and the cost of each (typically Â£20) are shown on the Club card. This is issued to all members and can be viewed on the Walks page.Please use email address to book a place on a walk""",Aberdeen,,,,,,Membership of the Club currently costs Â£30 with the subscription year starting in April.
